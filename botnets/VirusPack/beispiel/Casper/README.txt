Casper needs his friend Spooky to work fine. Spooky must live on your web site and
Casper must know where he lives.

//edit by lttcoder: har har very funny :) but what it is saying is that, you must upload the exe or the php files in spooky folder to a website. then you must write the location of the spooky in capsers source and compile it. I am not sure but maybe you write the commands that you want to send to casper in the php files. Very unique way of doing.
