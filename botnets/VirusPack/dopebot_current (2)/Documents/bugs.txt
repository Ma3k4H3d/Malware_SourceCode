1.	Melt dosent work under Win9x since batch is started before app is exited
	so the file is in use and Win9x dosent keep trying to delet like NT does.
	Added tempfix, batch_run(), tries to run batch on every startup on win9x
	when original file no longer should be running. Though i wanna add a melt
	hook or commandline deletion instead. Though commandline deletion wont do
	any good then removing bots. Iv already added melt.cpp, but the function
	in there crashes the remote process on Win9x when the Sleep shit is used,
	wich is _nessecary_.
	(bot.cpp, line 1027, install.cpp, line 22-37, line 170-171)
2.	IAT patching engine dosent work, need to change it to a overwriting one.
	(hook.cpp, line 48-83)
3.	Scanner dosent work as it should, it works fine while the threads are 
	started but once all threads are running it goes crazy and starts flooding
	irc with open ports and excess flood quits? I think this has to do with
	ranges that have alot of ports open cuz i only get this problem with this
	range: 83.140.33.0 (.130 and up, its a webhost i think).
	(scanner.cpp, line ?)
