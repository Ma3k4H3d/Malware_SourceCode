Moded spybot v1.3m done by: trusolja

nothing special, just spybot1.3a with clones hehe.
fixed a connect structure some bots wouldn't connect 
because the string was using \r\n, Adding ping option next
and char = "nick" option to give the bots ceratin names.


All credit to Mich for making the best toy in the world.

Just excuse those everything still works..

New shit:

1) Can now set name of bots 
2) Can now set name of clones
3) Took the nb spreader out of 1.4 and put it in 1.3

I know this is nothing special but people wanted 1.3 with clones
so I did it for them.
