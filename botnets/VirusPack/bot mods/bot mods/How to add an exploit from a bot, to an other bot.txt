Hey there, promissed to make a small tutorial bout this.
Well lets directly start

I'll explain you guys everything in just 4 steps :)


Before we begin, this is only for rBot, it can be used
in other bots but prolly the names of the folders and
files are different.


First step,
Get your bot where you want to rip the exploit out and
get a (stripped) bot where you want to add the exploit
to. The bot's have to be from the same type otherwise
you have to port the exploits, which means you got to
change the code of the exploit. (rBot, NZM, Hbot etc.)
are almost all same coding so that shouldn't be a problem)

second step,
Go into the directory folder of the bot you want to
rip the exploit out and find the files from which the
exploit is, for example netapi.cpp and netapi.h. Copy
them to the folder from the bot where you want to copy's
this files in.

Third step,
Now go back to the folder of the bot where you coppied
the netapi files from, and open advscan.h in notepad.
Search for the first string "EXPLOIT exploit[]={".
Underneath that you'll see this:
	Code:
	   #ifndef NO_SPREADNAME
   {"SPREADNAME", "SPREADNAME", 4444, spread, 0, TRUE, FALSE},
   #endif

Copy the one from netapi (so the one you want to add),
then close notepad, go to the bot you want to add the
spread on, open advscan and just pasté the code at the
same place from where you ripped it.

Fouth, and last step,
Now open the .dsp file of the source you want to add the
sploit on. Once it's opened, add the netapi.cpp in the
"Source Files" Folder, and the netapi.h in the "Header Files" Folder.
Once you've done that open includes.h scroll down and
at the bottom there add this: #include "netapi.h"

That's all, now you've added a sploit to your bot!
You can do this also with other files, probally you
have to rip some commands out of rbot.cpp but np?

If there are any questions, just ask.
