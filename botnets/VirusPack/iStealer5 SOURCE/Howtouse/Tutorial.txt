Register at http://www.blackapplehost.com/register.jsp

Step 2:
Go to UserCP.
Click "Create/delete MySQL database"

Name the database what you want, it will include your username.
In this example my username will be "example".

Press "Create Database"

Now for the user, I have named mine "example_user"
Password can be anything, mine will be "passw0rd"
Press "Create User"

For Assign Priviledges, make sure the user and database are selected on the list.
When all boxes are ticked, press "Assign Priviledges"

Step 3:
Open \iStealer5.1\PHP Logger\index.php and edit the configuration information.
All of the information is commented at the side, it's clear what it is. Leave localhost.

Step 4:
At BAH, go to "File manager" in the User CP and upload index.php & style.css
After this, your iStealer is set up, http://username.blackapplehost.com/index.php
Log in there to view your logs. Simple enough.
