Pr1muZ Fixed passwd.h / advscan.cpp / netbios.cpp/.h
-Who ever thinks ntpass scans on 445, quit botnets right now.
-Who ever thinks ntpass needs 39048320404 passwords, quit botnets right now.
-80% of ntpass is passwordless, common sense kids.
-Added more ntshares considering-They all sucked.
-I bet i'll find a million more things to fix in this src, so stay tuned.\
