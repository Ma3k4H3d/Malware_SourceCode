# A simple project started one stoned night   #
###############################################

1. Edit the settings as per your needs
2. Rename the file to fxBot.php
3. Upload to PHP webhost
4. Start the script (visit the url in your browser[http://server.com/fxBot.php])

The bot should then connect to irc and join the specified channels.
If not, oh well, I don't do support.

The commands are as follows;

!register   -   makes the bot register its nick with nickserv
!info       -   Displays the bots info
!quit       -   Makes the bot quit irc
!identify   -   makes the bot identify to nickserv
!boxuptime  -   displays the boxes uptime (the server you uploaded the script to)
